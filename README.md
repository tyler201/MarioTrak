# Mario-Trak

THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES PYTHON 3.6 OR HIGHER.

This is the official repository of MarioTrak. Although the program is easy to use, there are two files you should pay attention to.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first of which is the program itself. This contains all of the files you need to get started, in thier default state.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The backup file should be used if you want to revert the app back to it's original state. This can be useful if you decide you want a fresh start with all of the data you have.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your files can be duplicated from the program folder in an edited state and be used with a different version of the program. If you update the program, all you need to get from github is the new .py file and you should be good to go, unless stated otherwise. This should allow you to update without losing all of your data. The program is portable, so can be used on a USB stick should you choose to do so.

Things you shouldn't do:
1. Delete files and expect the program to not break.
2. Select the same user more than once in the data entry window. (This will be prevented in the next patch.)
3. Expect the progrm to look nice in it's early stages.
